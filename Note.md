Including:
**Formulating Research Questions**
**The Introduction**

### What is Research

- Research consists of questions and answers
- Research aims to contribte to, enrich, and revise prior scholarship
- Academic research presents arguable claims or testable hypotheses

#### Research is always deeply engaged with prior scholarship

Given what **previous scholars have written** about a given topic:

- What remains unknown in prior scholarship?
- What new questions are suggested by prior scholarship?
- Are there controversies of disagreements in prior scholarship?
- Is there new data that can extend existing knowledge?

#### Joining the Scholarly Conversation

Below is an abstract from a paper, and the highlight parts can be seen as a "Scholarly Conversation".

>**Abstract**
>*This research concerns how children learn the distinction between substance names andobject names. **Quine (1969) proposed** that children learn the distinction through learning thesyntactic distinctions inherent in count/mass grammar. However, **Soja et al. (1991) found that** English-speaking 2-year-olds, who did not seem to have acquired count/mass grammar,distinguished objects from substances in a word extension task, suggesting a pre-linguisticontological distinction.*

#### Research Results in arguable Claims or Hypotheses

**Arguable Claim**: One that a resonable and knowledgeable person can argue at.

### Developing Research Questions

#### Moving from Topic to Questions

Remember that a research topic **is not a viable research questions**.

#### Formulating Research Questions: Research begins with a question

You need to think: **What makes a research question viable and worthwhile?**
- The research questions addresses a genuie intellectual or empirical problems.
- The research questions articulates with existing scholarship.
- The research question is of the appropriate scope and complexity.
- The research question is answerable with available data.

#### How does one formulate a research question?

Questions come from existing scholarship: *gaps* in our knowledge, pre-existing scholarly debates and controversies, testing an existing theory or explanation with new data, extending a theory or explanation to a new context, etc.

Questions come from puzzling patterns in our data: sometimes questions seek to explain som aspect of one's data that is conterintutive puzzling or otherwise difficult to understand.

**Research questions can be stated as statements.** It's Ok.

#### Importance of the research question

A good research question is absoulutely vital, it's half of the paper.

### The Introduction of a Research Paper

#### Purpose of the Introduction

- The introduction presents the paper's **analytical or research question**.

- The introduction **provides context** for the analytical question. (*How does the question arise? Why is it interesting?*)

- The introduction presents the paper's **main claim or thesis** (answer to the question).

### Needed to narrow the topic and then form a question.
